# push_swap

Description:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

For 500
- under 5500 moves

For 100
- under 700 moves

Score: 100/100
